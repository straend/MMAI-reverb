CLI controls for parameters
- Dry/Wet: pourcentage -> 100% = Dry + Wet -> Wet= Dry -1
	but should be in dB and each very between 0 and 100%
	because one does not depends from the other
	If we use only one input parameter, it is better to 
	change the value of a variable named mix. 
- early reflections -> room size: %
	-> delay < 50/80ms; 100% cathedral, 0% closet
	The more the room is big the more: the delay is longer, 
	decay is longer, a bigger room sound
	small size means: short delays to a smaller room sound
	
-> Predelay: 0 to x milliseconds
	Time between Direct Signal and start of Reverb portion.
	The more space -> the greater the Predelay.
- late reverberation size
	Reverberance (%): 
	How long the reverberation continues 
	for after the original sound being reverbed comes to an end, 
	and so simulates the "liveliness" of the room acoustics. 
	For any given reverberance value, the tail will be greater 
	for larger room sizes.
- RT60: time required for reflections of a direct sound to decay 
	60 dB, RT60 = V/6A, V in m3, A: the equivalent absorption area
        A = soundAbsorptionCoeff[0->1]*Surface area

- Equalizer -> always 100% Wet
	Usually a Highshelf and/or Lowshelf EQ with variable Frequency.
	These EQs are only applied to the output of the reverb or 
	perhaps even just the reverb portion of the Reverb effect. 
	Some reverbs have Highshelf and Lowshelf EQs for the 
	Early Reflections as well.

- Damping: %, Increasing the damping produces a more "muted" effect. 
	The reverberation does not build up as much, 
	and the high frequencies decay faster than the 
	low frequencies. 
	Simulates the absorption of high frequencies in 
	the reverberation.
	Usually a Highshelf and/or a Lowshelf EQ with variable Frequency.
	These EQs are applied continuously to an evolving reverb of a piece 
	of audio. 
	Over time, as the reverb fades, so do certain frequencies, 
	either in the lower or higher frequency range. 
	The more less-reflective surfaces the sound bounces around from, 
	the more the reverb is dampened the higher frequencies.
